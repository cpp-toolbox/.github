# opengl-toolbox

The purpose of this organization is as follows:

* To store a collection of repositories which use eachother to build up a nice abstraction layer over opengl.
* To stop writing the same code, and doing it in a slightly different way each time, but rather improve the quality of existing code.
* To store minimal working examples of opengl code

Anyone is welcome to contribute
